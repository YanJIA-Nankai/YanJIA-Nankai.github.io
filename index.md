# Welcome to Yan Jia's Homepage

I'm a Lecturer Postdoctoral Fellowship in the College of Cyber Science at Nankai University. I received my ph.D. from School of Cyber Engineering at Xidian University in Dec. 2020. I'm interested in discovering and understanding new design/logic security vulnerabilites in real-world systems, including IoT (currently main direction), Web/Browser, mobile, network and other systems.
