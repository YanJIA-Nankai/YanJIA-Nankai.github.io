## Welcome to Yan Jia's Homepage

I'm a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow in the College of Cyber Science at Nankai University. I received my ph.D. from School of Cyber Engineering at Xidian University in Dec. 2020. I'm interested in discovering and understanding new design/logic security vulnerabilites in real-world systems, including but not limited to IoT (currently main direction), Web/Browser, mobile and OS.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/YanJIA-Nankai/YanJIA-Nankai.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
