# Welcome to Yan Jia's Homepage

I'm a Lecturer Postdoctoral Fellowship in the College of Cyber Science at Nankai University. I received my ph.D. from School of Cyber Engineering at Xidian University in Dec. 2020. I'm interested in discovering and understanding new design/logic security vulnerabilites in real-world systems, including IoT (currently main direction), Web/Browser, mobile, network and other systems.

## Impacts of My Research

### 2020
+ Vulnerabilities we discovered are assigned [CNVD-2020-68248](https://www.cnvd.org.cn/flaw/show/2621899), CNVD-2020-73400.

### 2019
+ The vulnerabilities in IoT cloud delegation process we discovered are acknowledged by Samsung SmartThings ($2000 bounty), Philips Hue.     

+ The design issues in authorization model of MQTT raise the concern of OASIS MQTT Technical Committee and are treated as major priority. [OASIS Open Issue MQTT-536](https://issues.oasis-open.org/projects/MQTT/issues/MQTT-536?filter=allopenissues)

### 2018
+ The vulnerabilities and design flaws I found in IoT platforms and MQTT influence many popular vendors including Amazon Web Service, Microsoft(awarded $2500 plus $4000), IBM, iRobot, Alibaba, Baidu, Tuya Smart, Suning (Critical), Eclipse Mosquitto, etc, which may cause illegal control, large-scale DoS, privacy leaks and device impersonation  .
