# Welcome to Yan Jia's Homepage

I'm a Research Associate (助理研究员、师资博士后) in the College of Cyber Science at Nankai University. I received my Ph.D. from the School of Cyber Engineering at Xidian University in December 2020. My interests inclulde discovering and understanding new design/logic security vulnerabilities in real-world systems, including IoT (currently main direction), Web/Browser, mobile, network, and other systems. Our works were published at top-lier academic and industrial conferences (e.g., Oakland, USENIX Security, CCS, Blackhat) and helped many high-profile parties (e.g., AWS, Microsoft, Google Chromium, IBM, Alibaba, Baidu, Apple, Samsung, Eclipse, iRobot, Philips, etc.) improve their systems' security. 
I am among active top authors in terms of publishing at leading security venues [System Security Circus](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/security-circus/authors.html).
